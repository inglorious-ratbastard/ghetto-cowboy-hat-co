##### Active Development Release: <br> https://inglorious-ratbastard.github.io/ghetto-cowboy-hat-co/
##### **About This Repo:**
<!-- ##### The original concept was to build something modern and flashy but not overdone to be submitted as part of a hackathon. It was left an incomplete template after discovering about the passing of a good friend. The project then became his namesake dedicated to depression awareness and suicide prevention. -->
